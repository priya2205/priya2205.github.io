         <p class="head">HOW TO BREW</p>
         <p class="heading">1. Filtration Method : </p>
         <p class="content">It can be a manual or an electric drip coffee maker. In either case, hot water drips through a basket that has ground coffee beans and then drips down to a pot below.

            You can buy one here (Opens in a new window)
            
            A variation is the Flip coffee pot. It consists of a bottom section filled with water, a middle filter section that holds the coffee, and an upside-down pot placed on the top. When the water boils, the coffee maker is flipped over to let the water filter through the coffee grounds.
            
            Indian Filter Coffee machine made of stainless steel; two cylindrical compartments, one fits atop the other with a covering lid on the top. The upper compartment has tiny holes. And then there is the perforated disc with a stick handle. The coffee is placed in the upper compartment, the perforated disc is used to cover the ground coffee, and hot water is poured on top of this disk. The coffee brew takes time to trickle down and hence the decoction is strong.
            
            </p>
         <p class="heading">Pour over is another coffee filtration process:</p>
         <p class="content">
            The ritual of the pour over is an experience of stillness: There’s no machine in your way. Just you and a few simple tools. The final cup is noticeably more delicate and complex. Observe the bloom, experience the first trace of coffee-drunk steam, notice how the spiral of the pour alters the final cup. Check this you tube link for a quick glance through the process. 
            Bring at least 200ml of water to a boil.
            Grind 15 grams of coffee to a coarseness resembling sea salt (Medium for a stronger cup). To enjoy the nuanced flavor of a single-origin coffee that is lightly roasted, we recommend less coffee: 23 grams for every 350 grams water.
            Place a filter in the dripper.
            Add the ground coffee to the filter and gently tap it to level the surface of the grounds. Place the brewer on a carafe or cup, place this entire set-up onto a digital scale, and set it to zero.
            Start a timer. Begin pouring water slowly over the coffee, starting at the outer rim and moving in a steady spiral toward the center of the grounds. 
            Starting in the center of the grounds, pour in a steady spiral toward the outer edge and then back toward the center
            Add milk and sugar to taste 
         </p>
         <p class="heading">2. Pressure Method :</p>
         <p class="content">The Italian stovetop coffeepot is a three-chamber design. Water boils in the lower section. The steam forces the boiling water up through coffee grounds held in the middle section, separated by a mesh from the top section. The coffee decoction is then collected in the top section.</p>
         <p class="heading">3. Steeping :</p>
         <p class="content">A French press is a cylinder with a plunger that has a metal mesh filter. The coffee powder is placed in the cylinder, and boiling water is then poured into it.  After 5-7 minutes the plunger is pushed down, leaving the filter just above the ground powder, allowing the coffee to be poured.

            Malaysian Coffee A simple muslin pouch, shaped like a filter, into which coffee is placed, and then steeped into hot water. This method is often used with local strong Robusta coffees of Malaysia.
            
            A Vacuum brewer constructed of two chambers: One atop the other with a tube in the centre. Water is placed in the pot, the coffee grounds are placed in the bowl on top, and the whole apparatus is set over a burner. As the water heats, it is forced by vapour pressure up the tube and into the chamber where it mixes with the ground coffee.  The water vapour in the pot cools and contracts, creating a partial vacuum and the coffee flows down through the filter.</p>
         <p class="heading">4. Boiling:</p>
         <p class="content">Turkish coffee, sugar, and water are placed in a narrow-topped pot (Ibrik) and brought to the boil (optionally 2-3 times) then instantly removed from the heat. The coffee can be flavoured with cardamom.

            A simpler method is to put the ground coffee in a cup, pour hot water over it and let it cool while the grounds sink to the bottom. In Indonesia this method is still used.
            
            It is essential that your equipment be cleaned after each use by rinsing it with hot water and towel drying. It’s best to soak the equipment in hot water to loosen all particles and then wash it. Clean thoroughly to avoid residual build-up of coffee oil.
